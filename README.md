# tukey_groups
This script allows you to run a Tukey's test and sort your experimental groups into statistical groups.

This script is my first script. I'm uploading it because it took me a long time to figure out on my own. It's simplistic but could be helpful for those that do not know R very well.

In order to prepare the data for this test, you need to create an excel file with two columns. In one column, add all of the data that you want to analyze. In the second column, add the names for the experimental groups corresponding to each data point. 

You will also need to import this excel file into R. I do this with the "Import from Excel" tab in the upper right hand corner of R studio. I am working on an easier way to do this.

I plan on incorporating a graphing function that will output a graph based on the data and the results from the Tukey's test.
