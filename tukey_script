## This script can be used to determine statistical groups via Tukey's test.

## Double check that your first column is numeric and your second is a character.

## We will now turn the data into a linear regression, from which an ANOVA
## and Tukey's test can be run.

## your_data corresponds to the dataframe that you imported, your_observations corresponds
## to the data that you are wishing to test and your_experimental_groups corresponds to the
## experimental groups that you are wishing to test

data.lm <- lm(your_data$your_observations ~ your_data$your_experimental_groups)

## Install the agricolae package and load it

install.packages("agricolae")

library(agricolae)

## Run the test. 

results <- HSD.test(data.lm, "your_data$your_experimental_groups" )
results

## You should now have the groups sorted from highest to lowest based on mean.
## The group letters are in the right most column
